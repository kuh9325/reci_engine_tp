# Engine Condition

Ignition Temperature=2394.5K

Atmosphere Air Pressure=101.325kPa

Atmosphere Air Temperature=298K

Specific Heat ratio(unburned)=1.31

Specific Heat ratio(burned)=1.21

Fuel : CH4 (Methane)

Fuel mass: stochiometric up to 100 atm. of max.combustor pressure


# Solve these Problems

1) Describe all equations employed for your work and consider residual gas effect

2) Recalculate the questions as same as those of Project #1

3) Compare engine efficiency for ignition at TDC and 20bTDC for 40 degree duration using the equation

4) Discuss all your results.
